# Simple Bot For Flappy Bird
## Description
Simple side project focused on toying and exploring neural networks.
I wrote as simple as possible Flappy Bird game to have easy access to graphic input for neural network's receptors. 
### How does it work?
I run many agents at the same 3 maps and score each of them basing on how far they got and how many obstacles they passed in summary.\
I run it on 3 different maps to slightly reduce chance that one random map will be easier to pass and will generate "weak"
bots that perform well.
### How well did it performed so far?
It managed to reach around 100 points (obstacles passed) and for some reason are stopping there.\
This final stop depends on luck, sometimes I got only 70 and sometimes it even reached 200.
### TO DO
1. Learn more about technics and algorithms used in neural networks.
2. Make it multithreaded.
## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017
## Used assets and libraries
SFML 2.5.2 for graphics
